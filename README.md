# Tensorflow/ VGG11、VGG16 and VGG19
   We reaccomplished the deeplearning algorithm vgg,based on the responsiblity url(https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg)which provide by machrisaa.
  1.We added vgg16.npy model into the lib,and achieved good classification consequence.
  2.Based on the 16-net and 19-net accomplishment of the original compliser, we modify the net and accomplish the 11-net-vgg<with vgg16.npy> ,but get bad consequence due to the 16vgg.npy is trained for the 16-net-vgg,if any guy has GPU to train the 11-net-vgg model,can add to it.
  3.In addition to the above two points, we add ten more test database (ten picture),and achieve good results.
